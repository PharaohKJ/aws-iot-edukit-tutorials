In this chapter, we download and install the software that you will need to view, edit, compile a binary firmware, and transfer the firmware to the device for it to run. Additionally, you'll be downloading an app on your phone to control the device.

## Silicon Labs USB to UART bridge driver installation
Download and install the SiLabs CP210x drivers to enable your computer to communicate with the Core2 for AWS IoT EduKit device. The on-board CP2104 is an USB-to-UART bridge to facilitate host communication with the ESP32-D0WD microcontroller:
{{%expand "macOS 10.9+" %}}
Since OS X Mavericks, Apple has included the necessary USB to serial drivers and no other steps are necessary. To verify that the drivers are installed, loaded, and the device is read for programming, connect the device via the provided USB-C cable and run:
```bash
ls -l /dev/cu.S*
```
If your host machine recognizes and is able to communicate with the device, you will see a return value of `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART` printed. If the results of the command above returns empty, check the physical connection first. If it doesn't resolve the issue, follow the instructions for macOS <= 10.8.

On macOS 10.13 and later, the installation of the SiLabs system extension may be blocked. To unblock, open your Mac's **System Preferences** <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> **Security & Privacy** pane, unlock changes by clicking the <i class="fas fa-lock"></i>, **allow** the developer, and then relock by clicking the <i class="fas fa-lock-open"></i>.

1) Disconnect the USB-C cable connecting your Core2 for AWS IoT EduKit device to your computer if it's already connected.
2) Download and extract the [CP210x VCP macOS driver](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip).
3) Expand the **SiLabsUSBDriverDisk.dmg** file from within the extracted folder.
4) Open the **Install CP210x VCP Driver** application and run through the installer.
5) Reboot your computer and reconnect your Core2 for AWS IoT EduKit device to your computer via the provided USB-C cable.

{{%expand "Linux" %}}
Linux kernel version 3.x.x and 4.x.x already include the drivers as part of the distribution. To verify they are installed and loaded, run the command in your terminal:
```bash
modinfo usbserial
modinfo cp210x
```
If they are *not* loaded, run the command:
```bash
sudo modprobe usbserial
sudo modprobe cp210x
```

1) Disconnect the USB-C cable connecting your Core2 for AWS IoT EduKit device to your computer if it's already connected.
2) Download and extract the [CP210x Universal Windows driver](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/CP210x_Universal_Windows_Driver.zip).
3) Open **CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe** and run through the installer to install the drivers.
4) Reboot your computer and reconnect your Core2 for AWS IoT EduKit device to your computer via the provided USB-C cable.

## Downloading and installing the phone apps.
The ESP RainMaker Phone Apps are available for iOS and Android phones to provide Wi-Fi network configuration, user-creation, user-device association and device control. The apps can be found here:
* Android: [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espressif.rainmaker), [Direct APK](https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker-android/releases)
* iOS: [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/esp-rainmaker/id1497491540)

If you do not posess a compatible Android or iOS device, you can use the [Rainmaker CLI](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/docs/cli-setup.html) and substitute instructions.

## Downloading the code
You can either download the code you'll be using throughout this program by cloning the repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/m5stack/Core2-for-AWS-IoT-EduKit), or download and extract the [zip file](https://github.com/m5stack/Core2-for-AWS-IoT-EduKit/archive/master.zip). To clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m5stack/Core2-for-AWS-IoT-EduKit.git
```
{{%expand "Windows" %}}
{{% notice info %}}
Windows has file path length limitations that can cause errors depending on where the project is placed. It is recommended that you clone this repo or extract the zip with a shorter initial path length if this error should occur (e.g. **C:\\**).

## Connecting and powering on the device
Lastly, let's make sure the device is plugged in to your computer and powered on. The device should automatically turn on once plugged in and connected to a power source, but if you need to turn it on, press the power button.
